**Project 1**
- In this project, the task was to create an Abstract Factory design pattern to create HTML and Markdown documents.
- Each concrete implementation of the Abstract Factory is to be implemented as a Singleton.
- As well, the document factory is to use a Factory Method to create elments in the document.
- The program will read in a .txt file, determine which type of document is to be instantiated and create and save the document.
-  Finally, the documents created should be opened in a Google Chrome browser.
